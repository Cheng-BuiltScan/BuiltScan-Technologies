				<h2><strong>Robotic inspection</strong></h2>
				<p>Our first technological breakthrough lies in the automated inspection capabilities of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). We have developed a 3D mission planning system that optimally maps routes for UAS data collection. The UAS autonomously navigates complex infrastructure environments, capturing high-resolution data with minimal human intervention. Integrated real-time data quality checks ensure comprehensive and accurate information gathering throughout the process. This approach significantly reduces human risk, minimizes site disruption, and provides unprecedented access to hard-to-reach or hazardous inspection areas. </p>

				<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> powered data analysis</h2>
				<p>We have trained an AI system through uses significant number of existing inspection reports from both New Zealand and overseas. The system can automatically detect, segment, and precisely measure potential defects. The AI system provide objective, consistent analysis that surpasses human visual inspection capabilities. By transforming raw visual data into detailed, quantifiable insights, we enable unprecedented accuracy in identifying and characterising built asset conditions, from minor surface irregularities to significant structural concerns.</p>

				<h2><strong>Digital Twin platform</strong> for visualisation, multi-layer data management, and decision support</h2>
				<p>At the core of the technology is a cloud-based DT platform that integrates multi-layer inspection data into a unified management system, enabling comprehensive asset tracking and analysis. Unlike traditional 2D PDF reports, we provide interactive 3D visualisations that make identifying and evaluating potential issues intuitive and precise. Most critically, built upon the structured data management, we are developing the world's first AI asset manager capable of automatically evaluating the asset's condition and generating tailored repair and maintenance strategies. This transforms raw data into actionable insights, providing asset managers with intelligent, data-driven recommendations for infrastructure management and renewal.</p>
