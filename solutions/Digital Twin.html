				<h2><strong>Manage and visualise multi-layer inspection data in 3D</strong></h2>
				<p>Our DT platform integrates fragmented visual and thermal inspection images into a 3D building information modelling (BIM) to create a comprehensive multi-layer data management. This integrated approach enhances structural evaluation precision, revealing defects that traditional methods might overlook. We are continuously expanding our platform to incorporate other common inspection data types as additional layers. The 3D visualisations are accessible through any web browser, allowing stakeholders to collaborate and share information seamlessly. </p>

				<h2><strong>Decision support</strong></h2>
				<p>Our DT platform enables precise damage assessment through accurate 3D real-world-scale models that pinpoint defect locations and allow detailed measurements. Historical inspection data can be easily tracked and compared to monitor damage evolution over time. Additionally, direct access to the integrated BIM model's design and construction information provides vital context for comprehensive condition assessments and maintenance planning. </p>
