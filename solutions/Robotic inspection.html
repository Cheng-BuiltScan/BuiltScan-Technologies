		<p class="subtext editable">Traditional, manual inspection often causes significant site disruption, poses serious safety risks to inspectors, and requires costly return visits due to data quality issues. Our advanced robotic inspection technology, powered by automated Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), transforms this process by eliminating manual access requirements, reducing safety risks, and capturing comprehensive high-quality data.</p>

				<h2><strong>3D mission planning</strong></h2>
				<p>Drawing on extensive research, we have established a comprehensive data collection strategy that ensures all requirements are met for rigorous and comprehensive inspection. Building on this foundation, our advanced 3D mission planning system automatically analyses the targeted structure and optimally maps routes for UAS data collection. This systematic approach ensures consistent, thorough coverage while maximising inspection efficiency. </p>

				<h2><strong>Data collection with robotics</strong></h2>
				<p>Our UAS platform executes precise data collection by following the pre-planned inspection routes. The UAS is equipped with either a dual camera configuration for visual and thermal imagery, or a visual camera and LiDAR sensor combination for high-resolution images and 3D point clouds. All data is captured simultaneously in a single pass. This automated approach significantly reduces human risk exposure, minimises site disruption, and enables thorough inspection of hard-to-reach or hazardous areas.</p>

				<h2><strong>Data quality assurance</strong></h2>
				<p>Our data quality assurance system rapidly assesses UAS-captured data against inspection requirements during the collection process. The system identifies potential quality issues, including image blurriness, improper exposure, limited coverage, or insufficient resolution. This enables prompt re-collection of any affected areas, ensuring comprehensive and accurate data capture within a single inspection session.</p>
