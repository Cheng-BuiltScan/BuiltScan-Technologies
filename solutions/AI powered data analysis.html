		<p class="subtext editable">Current damage analysis relies heavily on manual assessment. The number of built assets needing inspection continues to grow, yet the availability of skilled engineers remains limited, creating a serious operational bottleneck. Moreover, manual assessments are inherently subjective, with outcomes heavily dependent on individual expertise and experience. Our AI technology addresses these challenges through automated, objective assessment capabilities.</p>

				<h2><strong>Automated multi-class damage analysis with AI</strong></h2>
				<p>Our AI technology, trained on a comprehensive dataset of inspection reports from New Zealand and international sources, automatically detects, segments, and precisely measures defects in built assets. The AI analysis delivers objective, consistent results that surpass human visual inspection capabilities. By transforming raw visual data into detailed, quantifiable insights, we enable unprecedented accuracy in identifying and characterising built asset conditions, from minor surface irregularities to significant structural concerns. </p>
